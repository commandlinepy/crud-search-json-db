## Instructions

In the command line, RUN: `python book.py`

You will be asked to create a new Database file, for example: `sales` or you can select an existing one, for example: `contacts` (the .json suffix is automatically added).

All new Database files will be initialised using []

If you choose to create your own json file outside of the program it must be intialised with outer [] or include at least one set of data before running the program.


### todo

- close file

- add "no items in db" if empty

- db data items: improve formatting
